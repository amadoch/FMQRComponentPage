### Useful resources

- [Modzilla Developer Network](https://www.example.com) - This helped me for research any info about css and html. I really liked this platform, and will use it going forward becuase they have a lot more content about web development.
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/home) - Easy to use and deploy pages from github, but make sure they static.
